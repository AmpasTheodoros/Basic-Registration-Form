# Basic Registration Form

This repository contains a basic registration form built using React and Redux. The form allows users to enter their personal information, such as their name, email, and password, and submit the form to create an account.

## Getting Started

To use the form, clone or download the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the development server. The form can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features

- The form includes fields for users to enter their name, email, password, and password confirmation.
- The form checks for errors and displays error messages if any of the fields are invalid or if the passwords do not match.
- The form includes a submit button to create the account and a reset button to clear the form.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the form such as:

- The ability for users to login with their email and password.
- The ability to customize the appearance of the form, including the color and font.
- The ability to add additional fields, such as a phone number or address.
